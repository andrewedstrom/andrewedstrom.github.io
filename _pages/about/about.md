I am a Software Engineer. Currently, I work at Pivotal Cloud Foundry, where I contribute to open-source projects like [Concourse](https://concourse.ci/) and [BPM](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bpm-release).

My interests lie in distributed systems, cloud computing, security, and AI. I'm also an avid reader and language learner.

I started this blog so I could share some of the things I've learned so far.
