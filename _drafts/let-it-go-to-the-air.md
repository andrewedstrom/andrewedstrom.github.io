title:  "Let it go to the air"
---

Many years ago, a story in Guitar Player magazine taught me a lesson about
serenity.

Derek Trucks was recording with Eric Clapton for the album The Road to
Escondido. After they finished tracking, they sat around hanging out for a
while, with Clapton strumming his guitar as they talked. The conversation died
down, Clapton kept going, and according to Trucks it was the best he had ever
heard Clapton play. For those few minutes, he was a different guitarist. When
the music stopped, Trucks said, “Wow, I wish you had recorded that.” 

Clapton replied, “Sometimes, it just has to go to the air.”

I have thought about this ever since. And found that it applies to a lot more
than guitar playing: 

...Didn’t write down that revolutionary idea you had before bed and now you
can’t remember it?

...Hung out with an old friend and forgot to take a picture?

...Had a great conversation with someone on a plane but now you can’t find their
business card?

Why cling to what’s already lost? Instead, be glad you had the experience and
bid it farewell. Let it go to the air.
